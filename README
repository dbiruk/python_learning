1. Python ecosystem learning to get knew knowledge and skills:
    * virtual environment managing (venv, virtualenv, Pipenv)
    * packages and library dependencies management (pip, poetry etc)
    * python linting tools and rules configuration (flake8, black, isort etc).
    Delivery Results: Github repository with all necessary pre-configured rules/configs (including .pre-commit hooks) and best practises to be able to start python project fast from scratch.

2. Python type annotations learning to get knew knowledge and skills:
    * type annotations
    * mypy (configuration + static code analysis)
    Delivery Results: GitHub project repository (from Customer or Personal one) with python code that uses type annotations.
    
3. Start learning writing unit tests in python using PyTest (or other frameworks)
    Delivery Results: GitHub project repository (from Customer or Personal one) which contains test written in Python.
